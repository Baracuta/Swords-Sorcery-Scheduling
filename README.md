# Swords-Sorcery-Scheduling

## Overview
This is a simple tool I'm building to help me (and anyone else who wants to use it) schedule my TTRPG gaming sessions. Something very simple and user-friendly that will make it easier to figure out when everyone in a gaming group is available to play.

## Description
As a TTRPG enthusiast and D&D nerd, I'll be the first to admit that neither dragons, eldritch gods, nor falling rocks are the biggest threat to an adventuring party. That award goes to scheduling.

Trying to find a time when everyone can play is the most dangerous thing a gaming group can encounter.
