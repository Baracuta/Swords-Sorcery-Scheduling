# Swords-Sorcery-Scheduling

## Overview
This is a simple tool I'm building to help me (and anyone else who wants to use it) schedule my TTRPG gaming sessions. Something very simple and user-friendly that will make it easier to figure out when everyone in a gaming group is available to play.

## Description
As a TTRPG enthusiast and D&D nerd, I'll be the first to admit that neither dragons, eldritch gods, nor falling rocks are the biggest threat to an adventuring party. That award goes to scheduling.

Trying to find a time when everyone can play is the most dangerous thing a gaming group can encounter.

## Motivation
As a GM you're responsible for 90% of the work that goes into a TTRPG session, but none of that hard work sees the light of day if you never actually get to run what you've prepared. With everything else you have to do, trying to figure out when everyone can actually get together to play can be incredibly frustrating and exhausting.

As a GM myself, I've experienced this firsthand. My goal with this app is to provide a simple, beautiful, but fool-proof tool to TTRPG players to take the hassle out of scheduling your next game.
